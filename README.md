# Module-1: What is NVivo?

## Workshop Overview
In this workshop, you will learn the fundamental building blocks of NVivo: coding and file management. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop you will understand how to:
1. Navigate NVivo's User Interface
2. Import files
3. Create nodes
4. Code textual data

## Prerequisites
### Installing NVivo
#### University of Melbourne Staff
University departments, affiliated institutions and respective staff are eligible to obtain NVivo under a university site license. This license extends to home use. For installation instructions see the knowledge base article on NVivo
- Contact Infrastructure Services to request NVivo
- Phone 8344 0888
- Log a Service Now Request online using your University of Melbourne username and password
- Download a trial versions of NVivo

#### University of Melbourne Students
Download a trial version of NVivo and use the license key provided on Student IT's Software License Keys site for full access
Students and staff may also access NVivo on myUniApps. Please note that  NVivo cannot be accessed via the 'Apps' tab. For access:
- Click the 'Desktops' tab at the top of the page
- Click the 'Start' menu from within a Desktop
- Select the required software icon (in this case 'QSR'), then NVivo 11 folder then NVivo 11 program

#### Other Users
Download a trial version of NVivo. It will last for 14 days, which is enough time to work through the modules provided in this course.
Qualitative and Mixed-Methods Research Methods
This course presupposes a basic understanding of qualitative and mixed-methods research methodology. This course is primarily about how NVivo can be used within these methodologies. It is not a course in the methodologies themselves. A bibliography is provided here with links to resources that students may find useful.

## Participation Requirements
Our trainings are accessible and encourage participation. We want you to come in curious and willing to meet other researchers!
- Be prepared: be ready and able to be involve yourself in learning.
- Engage: actively participate in the community and course materials.
- Think critically: analyse materials presented to form reasonable judgements.
- Respect others: listen to and be considerate of others; practice gratitude.

### Online Workshops
If you are attending one of our Zoom workshops, please make sure that you have downloaded Zoom. 
For students at the University of Melbourne, instructions on how to do so are provided here. 

If you are not attending an online workshop, I would still encourage that you try to get involved in the NVivo researcher community at the University of Melbourne. We have launched a Facebook group which you can join here.
Make sure to stay up to date with news about the NVivo community by subscribing to our monthly newsletter here.

## Training Format 

This module consists of four sections. If you are participating in an online zoom workshop, each section will take around 10 minutes, with 20 minutes at the end of the workshop for unstructured questions.

If you are not attending an online workshop, then you are encouraged to move through the sections at your own pace. 
At the end of each section is a challenge. This challenge aims to test your learning, and to provide a practical problem that you may need to solve outside of this learning environment in your own research.

## Assessment

This is a self-assessed module. At the end of the module, students will be asked to provide feedback. Whilst this feedback is immensely valuable to the community coordinator, it is also the means by which students assess their own learning. Students are encouraged to reflect on the learning objectives, and to repeat the module if necessary.
